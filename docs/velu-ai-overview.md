## What is Velu AI?

Velu AI is an autonomous documentation assistant designed to keep product knowledge accurate without relying on manual upkeep. It ingests signals from everyday product and support workflows—across tools such as Slack, GitHub, Linear, Confluence, Notion, Google Drive, and ticketing systems—and continuously transforms that context into structured documentation updates. Velu AI operates as the "documentation brain" for modern SaaS teams, detecting when content is stale, drafting safe updates, and orchestrating publishing across the company’s docs stack.

## Why it Matters

Modern SaaS organizations struggle to keep onboarding guides, API references, and help centers aligned with fast-moving releases. This drift slows developer productivity, increases support volume, and erodes customer trust. Velu AI closes that gap by targeting measurable outcomes such as keeping fewer than 5% of documents older than the latest release, automating at least 70% of routine updates, and shrinking the time-to-doc from feature launch to within 24 hours.

## Key Capabilities

- **Context ingestion:** Captures product knowledge from conversations, tickets, specs, and rich media (including video and screenshots) so nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Autonomous updates:** Detects outdated content, drafts revisions with hallucination safeguards, and can auto-generate net-new articles, changelogs, or onboarding flows.
- **Publishing orchestration:** Pushes approved updates to destinations such as GitHub repos, Confluence, Mintlify, GitBook, and other documentation platforms while preserving version history.
- **Governance and safety:** Supports role-based approvals, audit trails, and data-privacy controls so teams can scale automation without losing oversight.
- **Interaction surfaces:** Offers a Slack command, GitHub PR assistant mode, Chrome capture tooling, and an "Ask Velu" chat interface for on-demand drafting and review.

## Who Velu AI Serves

Velu AI focuses on cross-functional product teams that need trustworthy documentation at scale:

- **Technical writers** who must enforce style consistency and review flows despite scattered context.
- **Product managers** who need documentation synchronized with upcoming launches and roadmaps.
- **Developers** who require current API docs and implementation guides that track code changes.
- **Support and customer success teams** who rely on accurate FAQs to resolve issues quickly.
- **Founders and early-stage SaaS teams** who want production-grade documentation without staffing a full writing function.

## Product Status and Roadmap

- **Document owner:** Aravind Kumar (Product Requirements Document v1.0).
- **Target launch window:** Phase 1 is planned for the Q1–Q2 2026 timeframe.
- **Future phases:** Expansion includes autonomous UI capture, personalized documentation per customer, and a fully continuous documentation engine.

Velu AI ultimately aims to transform documentation from a reactive chore into a continuous, automated knowledge system that mirrors every product change with minimal human intervention.
